StabbyPhone is the software behind the Mr. Stabby IVR software shown at 
the May 2010 TechCrunch Disrupt Hackday in New York City. 

It uses the Twilio API to publish voice and decision trees to a phone 
number. Based on keypad entries, an indicator on the web server is 
modified which is continually polled by an Arduino on the robot. This 
Arduino reads the command and controls Mr. Stabby's motion.
